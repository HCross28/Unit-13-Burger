# Unit-13-Burger

The Unit 13 Burger Eater App is designed to show eaten burgers, un-eaten burgers and allows for adding and deleting of buger items. 

Backend functionality along with the SQL database are all seemingly working fine. Node server is able to connect and listens on the approprate PORT. 

At the time of turn-in the Handlebars front end presentation is lacking, and due to what I believe may be a class or id naming issue I may have broken my devour function. Creating and Deleting the burgers do function as needed. 

In the Apps file tree you will find a folder titled "Heroku" inside are screenshots of the issues shown via the "heroku logs --tail" command. Clicking on the Heroku link shows an error screen and I'm nor sure how to get around it. 

Thanks for your time!
